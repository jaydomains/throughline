# Execution-overseer — audit-remediation wake-log

One line per event (role §5). Ref-moving commits on this branch wake the executor + auditor;
this file is also my durable loop-state memory across compaction. Format per role §5:
last-seen remote HEAD · finding-set-diff (`N dropped / M added`) · per-thread `X/5` · convergence/
execution state when relevant.

**Overseer branch:** `claude/blissful-brown-POKvS` · **Cohort:** audit-remediation (A1…D3, M-10 last).

  execution-overseer.md), the approved plan (`2026-06-06-audit-remediation-plan.md`, PR #135), and
  the audit summary (`2026-06-06-end-to-end-summary.md`). Ground truth: remote `main` @ `ffa01ed`
  (local `main` ref stale @ `4c1ab1b` — ignored; origin/main is truth). **No open PRs; no
  executor/auditor branches yet.** Pre-registered governance positions committed
  (`2026-06-07-execution-overseer-remediation-positions.md`). Finding-set-diff:
  `0 dropped / 0 added (baseline — positions pre-registered, no findings yet)`. Loop state:
  **awaiting executor's first slice PR (A1 — fastify 4→5)**. Watcher to be armed on broad scan
  (executor/auditor branch names unknown until A1 opens). Last-seen remote HEAD before this commit:
  `ffa01edd44d589458edf5a8b639895ba557e0c49`.
