# Execution-overseer — audit-remediation wake-log

One line per event (role §5). Ref-moving commits on this branch wake the executor + auditor;
this file is also my durable loop-state memory across compaction. Format per role §5:
last-seen remote HEAD · finding-set-diff (`N dropped / M added`) · per-thread `X/5` · convergence/
execution state when relevant.

**Overseer branch:** `claude/blissful-brown-POKvS` · **Cohort:** audit-remediation (A1…D3, M-10 last).

- **2026-06-07T08:25Z** — SESSION START / BASELINE. Read discipline floor (REQUIRED_READING +
  execution-overseer.md), the approved plan (`2026-06-06-audit-remediation-plan.md`, PR #135), and
  the audit summary (`2026-06-06-end-to-end-summary.md`). Ground truth: remote `main` @ `ffa01ed`
  (local `main` ref stale @ `4c1ab1b` — ignored; origin/main is truth). **No open PRs; no
  executor/auditor branches yet.** Pre-registered governance positions committed
  (`2026-06-07-execution-overseer-remediation-positions.md`). Finding-set-diff:
  `0 dropped / 0 added (baseline — positions pre-registered, no findings yet)`. Loop state:
  **awaiting executor's first slice PR (A1 — fastify 4→5)**. Watcher to be armed on broad scan
  (executor/auditor branch names unknown until A1 opens). Last-seen remote HEAD before this commit:
  `ffa01edd44d589458edf5a8b639895ba557e0c49`.

- **2026-06-07T08:42Z** — A1 (PR #140) GOVERNANCE REVIEW + FINAL-MARKER. Wake: REF on
  `claude/cool-cannon-J9BR5` (executor draft A1 opened @ `010a4027`, then →`8036839`). On-wake
  pairing done: fetched both new tips, diffed, read PR #140 comments/reviews/checks. Identities
  confirmed — executor=`claude/cool-cannon-J9BR5`, execution-auditor=`claude/sharp-cerf-mZ381`
  (b96c72c, pre-registered positions only). Executor's `8036839` is a **content-invariant
  final-marker** (handover + wake-log only; `git diff …-- packages/` empty → code/deps
  byte-identical to `010a4027`), so it does **not** re-stale; convergence binds to content @
  `8036839`. CI green @ `8036839` (gate ✓ · Gitar ✓). Governance review posted (PR #140 comment
  4641974179): **EO-1…EO-6 Confirm/Note** (scope-clean; floor-bump `^5.8.3` in-scope not class-iii;
  no anchor touched; sequencing/collision OK; gate+post-work docs OK; `@xenova` optionalDependencies
  carried to A2), **EO-7 Push-back** = merge-method **OQ-2** (class-iv) surfaced to spec-author.
  **Status: final — approved by execution-overseer @ `8036839`** (governance content clean).
  Finding-set-diff: **0 dropped / 7 added (EO-1…EO-7)**. Per-thread: EO-1…EO-6 closed (Confirm/Note,
  0/5); EO-7 surfaced to spec-author (0/5 — awaiting ruling, not an executor round-trip).
  **Convergence state:** executor ✓ · overseer ✓ · **execution-auditor PENDING** · CI ✓.
  **Execution gated on:** (1) auditor final-marker @ `8036839` content, (2) override window,
  (3) **OQ-2 merge-method ruling** (authenticated channel). Last-seen remote HEADs: overseer
  `7f668bd` · executor `8036839` · auditor `b96c72c` · main `ffa01ed`.

- **2026-06-07T08:44Z** — OQ-2 SURFACED → spec-author **DEFERRED** ("do not proceed, wait for
  next instruction"). Surfaced OQ-2 (merge-method, class-iv) via the authenticated in-session
  human channel; spec-author dismissed without ruling and instructed to wait. **OQ-2 remains
  unruled** → A1 execution stays **blocked** on the merge-method ruling (per EO-7 gate). No
  re-ask; I hold per instruction. Finding-set-diff: **0 dropped / 0 added** (no change to the
  EO set; EO-7 stays open, surfaced-pending). Loop state: **A1 NOT converged** (executor ✓ ·
  overseer ✓ · execution-auditor marker PENDING · CI ✓); execution additionally gated on the
  pending OQ-2 ruling + override window. Standing by: watcher armed (`claude/` scope, self-excl,
  60s) for (1) execution-auditor's A1 final-marker, (2) any executor revision, (3) the
  spec-author's next instruction / OQ-2 ruling. Reviewer-side asymmetry holds — the executor
  re-initiates; I do not self-wake to merge.

- **2026-06-07T08:46Z** — OQ-2 **RULED by spec-author** (authenticated in-session human channel;
  **explicit · current · class-(iv) ratification on record**): **SQUASH** for the entire
  audit-remediation cohort — review-topology axis is dispositive (any role-trio-reviewed PR
  squash-merges); applies to **A1 and every subsequent slice**. The "merge-commit for build-slice
  chain" M-7 clause is scoped to the auto-continue chain running **without** trio review. **B1
  must rewrite AUTO_CONTINUE §D to make this predictable** (review topology ⇒ method:
  trio-reviewed ⇒ squash; non-trio auto-continue ⇒ merge-commit) — recorded as a B1 governance
  requirement. **EO-7 RESOLVED** (merge method settled = squash). Finding-set-diff: **1 dropped /
  0 added** — dropped EO-7 (resolved: OQ-2 ruled squash via authenticated channel). Remaining EO
  set: EO-1…EO-6 (all Confirm/Note, closed). **Spec-author also pre-authorized A1 execution**
  ("Execute A1 once auditor's marker lands… you execute directly") → present ratification
  **collapses the override window to zero** (role §8.2). **A1 execution gate now:** ONLY the
  **execution-auditor's final-marker** at the `8036839` content + green CI at that SHA (3 markers
  at one SHA: executor ✓ · overseer ✓ · auditor PENDING). On the auditor's marker I re-confirm the
  gate from ground truth, then **squash-merge A1 directly** (flip draft→ready → squash). Watcher
  armed for the auditor's marker. Last-seen: overseer `1ce34df`→(this commit) · executor `8036839`
  · auditor `b96c72c` · main `ffa01ed`. Standing by per "stand by for next surface."

- **2026-06-07T08:50Z** — **A1 (PR #140) MERGED — execution complete.** Convergence reached:
  3 markers at one change-content (executor `c2de0eb` / auditor `c4e4055`→`2bf23a5` refreshed to
  `c2de0eb` / overseer `1ce34df`), all content-bound to byte-identical code (`010a4027`=`8036839`
  =`c2de0eb` on `packages/`+lockfile). CI green @ `c2de0eb` (gate ✓ · Gitar ✓); `mergeable_state:
  clean`. OQ-2 ruled **squash** (class-iv ratified, authenticated); override window collapsed
  (present spec-author authorization). **Executed: flip draft→ready → squash-merge.** Merge call
  returned `36be75a merged:true`; **verified from `git ls-remote`**: `main` `ffa01ed`→`36be75a`,
  single squash commit on `main`, executor branch `claude/cool-cannon-J9BR5` **deleted**,
  `fastify ^5.8.3` on `main`. Merge-confirmation posted as its own event (PR #140 comment
  4641992282). Finding-set-diff: **0 dropped / 0 added** (A1 EO set closed at merge). **A1 done.**
  Carry-forward to A2: `@xenova` optionalDependencies vs C-D2 (EO-6). **Loop state: awaiting A2**
  (embeddings-stack swap; class-(i) C-D2 anchor change — M-1 settled, ratification collapses if I
  confirm current via authenticated channel + verify the C-D2 amendment matches intent). Sequenced-
  cycle / standing-driver posture: **NOT** bounded-stand-down between slices — staying actively
  subscribed; re-arming watcher (`claude/` scope) for the next executor slice + auditor. Last-seen:
  overseer `cbf43fd`→(this commit) · main `36be75a` · auditor `2bf23a5` · executor branch gone.

- **2026-06-07T08:5xZ** — A2 executor branch `claude/a2-embeddings-protobufjs` @ `2b1f4fda`
  detected (REF wake). **A2 pre-read governance positions (recorded BEFORE reading the diff —
  anti-anchoring §4.2):**
  - **EO/A2-P1 (ratification class-(i) — C-D2):** A2 amends C-D2 (anchor). This is a §8.3(i)
    ratification class → does **NOT** auto-merge. M-1 is settled (my dispatch brief), so
    ratification should **collapse to ~0**, BUT only after I (a) confirm M-1 is **current** via the
    authenticated channel and (b) verify the **C-D2 amendment matches the settled intent** — the
    amendment must reflect the new embeddings stack **and** the already-true hard-dep reality
    (currently mis-described as "optional first-launch download"; already narrowed by T-D60). A bad
    C-D2 edit ≠ ruled; I hold if it overreaches the anchor's intent.
  - **EO/A2-P2 (EO-6 carry-forward):** the `@xenova/transformers` `optionalDependencies` nuance
    must be reconciled in the C-D2 text (the "optional" key bears on the "optional first-launch
    download" wording). Verify the amendment addresses it, not papers over it.
  - **EO/A2-P3 (scope):** A2 = embeddings-stack swap only (`@xenova/transformers@2` →
    `@huggingface/transformers@3` per plan, or whatever actually clears the advisory) + lockfile +
    `embeddings.ts` API adaptation + C-D2 body. Must **not** touch other slices' files. Base must
    be current `main` @ `36be75a` (A1 landed; serial on `package.json`).
  - **EO/A2-P4 (advisory clearance, the substantive bar):** the **Critical protobufjs** (+4 High)
    must actually be **cleared in the resolved tree** — override-alone can't lift it (onnx-proto@4
    pins protobufjs ^6.8.8), so a real stack swap is required. Verify `pnpm audit --prod` before/
    after; the Critical must be gone, not merely re-pinned.
  - **EO/A2-P5 (flake — P-FLAKE):** A2 exercises `rag.test.ts` (flagged flake). Any CI failure is a
    **finding to root-cause/stabilize, never re-run-until-green** — rests on the already-codified
    circuit-breaker floor (A2 precedes B1's extended-halt codification).
  - **EO/A2-P6 (merge method):** **squash** (OQ-2 ruled, class-iv on record) — applies to A2.
  Finding-set-diff: **0 dropped / 0 added** (A2 positions pre-registered, no findings yet). Now
  reading the A2 PR + diff. Last-seen: main `36be75a` · auditor `2bf23a5` · A2 executor `2b1f4fda`.

- **2026-06-07T09:1xZ** — A2 (PR #141) GOVERNANCE REVIEW posted (comment 4642051049). On-wake
  pairing done: scope via `git diff --name-only` (8 files, all in-scope), read C-D2 amendment
  (`CODE_SPEC.md`), `embeddings.ts` (import-spec + comment only), `package.json` (stays
  optionalDependency), and both test diffs (**comment-only**, no flake-masking). **EO-8 Confirm**
  scope-clean; **EO-9 Confirm** C-D2 amendment matches settled M-1, class-(i)/(ii) ratification
  **collapsed to ~zero** via settled-authenticated M-1 (dispatch brief; current, not superseded);
  **EO-10 Confirm** dep-declaration correction (optionalDependency, not the plan's "hard dep") =
  expected within-trio resolution of pre-flagged EO-6/CN-1, transparently surfaced → **no human
  surface required**; **EO-11 Confirm-pending-CI** advisory 10→1 (Critical/High → 0; auditor
  re-verifies), rag.test 16/16; **EO-12 Note** heavier onnxruntime-node/sharp footprint → A3/D1.
  Finding-set-diff: **0 dropped / 5 added (EO-8…EO-12)**. **Final-marker HELD pending green CI @

- **2026-06-07T09:xxZ** — A3 executor branch `claude/a3-residual-sweep` @ `d5a897f` detected.
  **A3 pre-read governance positions (BEFORE reading the diff — anti-anchoring §4.2):**
  - **EO/A3-P1 (scope):** A3 = residual advisory sweep after A1+A2 — address remaining Moderate
    advisories (react-router; E17a-deferred vite/esbuild) where a clean bump exists, lockfile, +
    record an honest dep-posture statement. Base must be current `main` @ `7632f1a` (serial on
    package.json after A2). Must not touch other slices' files.
  - **EO/A3-P2 (PLATFORM_STATUS collision — KEY WATCH):** plan §5 A3 *intent* is to correct the
    "mere version bumps" mischaracterization, but the **deliverable + collision rule** say A3
    records the corrected posture text **in its handover, ready for M-10 to fold into
    PLATFORM_STATUS** — **M-10 is the LAST slice and owns the PLATFORM_STATUS full refresh; never
    open it early (plan §3.B / §6)**. So A3 should **NOT directly edit `PLATFORM_STATUS.md`**. If it
    does, that's a sequencing/collision finding (Push-back). The posture text belongs in the A3
    handover.
  - **EO/A3-P3 (honest residual):** any accepted residual must carry an explicit reachability
    rationale (127.0.0.1 bind, single-user, lazy path) — not silently dropped. `pnpm audit --prod`
    clean OR an explicitly-recorded accepted-residual set.
  - **EO/A3-P4 (ratification / merge):** A3 is a **normal slice** (plan §4 — auto-merges on the
    standard gate; not a ratification class). Merge method **squash** (OQ-2). Execute directly on
    convergence.
  - **EO/A3-P5 (gate + flake):** three-layer gate green; if A3 bumps vite (frontend build), watch
    for breakage; any flake is a finding, not a re-run.

- **2026-06-07T10:0xZ** — D1 executor branch `claude/d1-deploy-wiring` @ `874cb8c` detected.
  **D1 pre-read governance positions (BEFORE reading the diff — anti-anchoring §4.2):**
  - **EO/D1-P1 (ratification — CONDITIONAL, KEY WATCH):** D1 = M-2, **planner-scoped, NO settled
    spec-author ruling**. Class-(ii) **only if** the SPEC §11 fallback (amend `SPEC.md` §11) is
    taken. **Decision rule:** if the diff edits `SPEC.md` (fallback) → class-(ii) spec amendment
    with no settled ruling → **I SURFACE to spec-author for ratification before merge**. If it
    takes the **primary path** (provide a real single-command setup, no SPEC edit) → **normal
    slice, execute directly.** I determine the path by whether `SPEC.md` is touched.
  - **EO/D1-P2 (scope):** D1 touches `start` script (`packages/backend/package.json`),
    `docs/install/auto-start.md`, + a new single-command setup script. Base must be current `main`
    @ `7d0a252` (after Group A; shared package.json). No reach into other slices' files (no SPEC
    unless fallback; no CODE_SPEC; no AUTO_CONTINUE; no PLATFORM_STATUS — that's M-10).
  - **EO/D1-P3 (substantive bar):** `pnpm build` then `node dist/index.js` must boot on
    `127.0.0.1:47823` under **NODE_ENV=production** (prod module resolution, not the `development`
    condition); single-command setup runs clean from a **fresh clone**. Auditor verifies the boot.
  - **EO/D1-P4 (honesty / no silent partial):** primary path must make SPEC §11/§3's single-command
    claim **TRUE** (provide the setup) — NOT ship "document the manual reality" alone, which would
    leave SPEC §11 false and recreate the claimed-but-unbuilt drift this cohort closes. Fallback
    (SPEC amend) only if genuine single-command setup is infeasible — and that's the surfaced
    class-(ii) path.
  - **EO/D1-P5 (footprint — EO-12 carry-forward):** the single-command setup + deploy path should
    handle the A2 native `onnxruntime-node`/`sharp` optionalDependency postinstall gracefully
    (pnpm continues if it fails; lazy + T-D60 fallback). Watch the setup doesn't hard-fail on it.

- **2026-06-07T1x:xxZ** — B1 executor branch `claude/b1-governance-doctrine` @ `4ebf3d4` detected.
  **B1 pre-read governance positions (BEFORE reading the diff — anti-anchoring §4.2; HEAVIEST
  slice, class-(iv) durable precedent):**
  - **EO/B1-P1 (§D matches authenticated OQ-2 ruling):** AUTO_CONTINUE §D rewrite must say:
    **review topology determines merge method — any role-trio-reviewed PR squash-merges; the
    auto-continue chain running WITHOUT trio review uses merge-commit.** This is the spec-author's
    explicit OQ-2 ruling (authenticated, on record). Must replace the self-disproving "every PR is
    a two-parent merge; squash not used" invariant. Deviation from the ruling → hold + surface.
  - **EO/B1-P2 (halt 4–9 trace to BLESSED sources — NO invention; the load-bearing check):**
    codify six classes. Plan §5 B1 map: halt-4=estimate breach
    (`audits/2026-05-31-phase-e-execution-audit-1.md:50,61`), halt-5=unplanned anchor
    (`plans/2026-05-30-phase-e-full-audit-close.md:194,350`), halt-6=fingerprint-staleness,
    halt-7=**murkiest** (likely-invention candidate), halt-8=flake (`…execution-audit-1.md:51`),
    halt-9=blessed decision-gate (`…full-audit-close.md:342,403`). **Each codified class MUST cite
    a traceable blessed Phase-E source.** If any (esp. halt-7) is invented/untraceable → that's an
    **unauthorized class-(iv) mint** the executor should have surfaced, not authored → **I HOLD +
    SURFACE to the human spec-author.** I independently spot-check the cited sources.
  - **EO/B1-P3 (no role-file edits — OV-1):** B1 lands entirely in the project layer (AUTO_CONTINUE).
    Must NOT edit `.claude/roles/*` (they externalize halt-classes by-category + merge-method as a
    REQUIRED_READING param; no back-port owed). A role-file edit = scope finding.
  - **EO/B1-P4 (REQUIRED_READING §4 pointer is B3's, not B1's):** B1 must NOT edit
    `REQUIRED_READING.md` (the §4 "owed work" pointer flip is B3, to avoid the §4/§5 collision).
    Verify REQUIRED_READING untouched. (Ruling says §7 already reflects dual-context — **verify,
    do not re-edit** unless verification fails.)
  - **EO/B1-P5 (scope):** AUTO_CONTINUE_WORKFLOW.md only (§D + halt-class section). Base = current
    main `fb25642`. Doc-only → CI must still be green.
  - **EO/B1-P6 (ratification disposition):** class-(iv). IF §D matches OQ-2 + all halt classes
    trace to blessed sources + no role-file/REQUIRED_READING edit → class-(iv) **covered by the
    authenticated OQ-2 ruling + settled M-8** → execute directly. ELSE → hold + surface.

  anchor · 6=test-regression · 7=doc-PR-collision · 8=out-of-audit-silent-failure · 9=decision-gate,
  which **matches the executor's codification one-for-one → NONE invented** (the PLAN's map was the
  imprecise one; plan called it a "starting map" + directed pulling from canonical source → faithful,
  not a departure). §D rewrite matches authenticated OQ-2 (review-topology axis; trio⇒squash incl.
  trio-reviewed auto-continue chain; bare runner⇒merge-commit). Scope: AUTO_CONTINUE only, **no
  role-files (OV-1), no REQUIRED_READING (§4 ptr left for B3)**. Posted review (comment 4642385796):

- **2026-06-07T1y:yyZ** — **⚠️ WATCHER-LAPSE (recorded honestly) + B2 detected.** A monitor
  (`bonofprpj`) died (cap) and I did **not** re-arm promptly — coverage lapsed, and the **B2
  executor branch `claude/b2-ci-enforcement` @ `830bbf3` opened during the unarmed gap.** Surfaced
  by the **mandated on-wake `git ls-remote`** (skill: "detection is not awareness; the durable
  record + remote is the source of truth, not the wake event") after a spec-author prompt, not by a
  wake. Corrective: re-armed `bpl1aug3x`; tightening the **re-arm-on-every-stop / proactive-re-arm**
  discipline. No convergence was missed (B2 only just opened). **B2 pre-read governance positions
  (anti-anchoring §4.2, before reading diff):**
  - **EO/B2-P1 (scope + PLATFORM_STATUS collision — KEY WATCH):** B2 = M-13. Edits `ci.yml` (remove
    "advisory" header note `:9-13`) + `AUTO_CONTINUE_WORKFLOW.md` (remove the hedge `:24`). Must
    **NOT edit `PLATFORM_STATUS.md`** — only *verify* `:37` already says "DONE" and leave it
    (PLATFORM_STATUS full refresh is **M-10's**, last slice, §3.B collision). A PLATFORM_STATUS edit
    = collision finding.
  - **EO/B2-P2 (AUTO_CONTINUE after B1):** base = current `main` @ `9501018` (incl. B1). Verify the
    `:24` advisory hedge still exists post-B1 (B1 touched §D/halt/premise, not the :24 hedge) and B2
    removes it correctly; no clobber of B1's §D/halt codification.
  - **EO/B2-P3 (M-13 core — consistency):** all three statements (ci.yml · AUTO_CONTINUE ·
    PLATFORM_STATUS) end consistent — gate **IS** the enforcing required-check on `main`; **no
    "advisory" survives**.
  - **EO/B2-P4 (ratification):** **normal slice** — M-13 settled; ci.yml/AUTO_CONTINUE/PLATFORM_STATUS
    not in the class-(ii) spec-record set → not a ratification class → execute directly.
  - **EO/B2-P5 (merge):** squash (OQ-2). **EO/B2-P6 (gate):** green; yaml/doc-only.

- **2026-06-07T1z:zzZ — ⚠️ §8.3 AUTHENTICATED-CHANNEL CHECKPOINT — rag-stabilization slice on a

  pin rag.test.ts/library.test.ts default harness to a new additive `createFallbackEmbedder()`
  export; zero production change; 610/610 ×5, 0 model-load lines — a clean root-cause test-infra fix).
  **BUT** the executor's wake-log + handover both assert *"spec-author Option A ruling, 2026-06-07,
  authenticated in-session."* **I (overseer) have NOT received any A/B/C ruling through my
  authenticated channel** — I surfaced A/B/C; the human's only later message was the watcher-arming
  correction, NOT a rag ruling. Per §8.3 + AUTO_CONTINUE "authenticated ratification": a ruling
  relayed under the shared role-session identity is **PENDING until confirmed through my channel**;
  this is a **class-(iii) scope expansion** (a slice beyond the plan's 14; M-14 was "no action") →
  **I do NOT merge on the relayed claim** (role-file cited failure: a relayed ruling once drove a
  wrong-artifact merge). I offered THREE options (A/B/C) — cannot infer which from the executor
  building A. **Action: surfaced to the human to CONFIRM the ruling (A/B/C) through the authenticated
  channel before merge.** Merge gate HELD on the missing authenticated ratification; governance
  review may proceed in parallel. (Auditor-lane note: pinning tests to the fallback stops exercising
  the real @huggingface embedder in CI — reasonable per the embedder-agnostic T-D60 design, but a
  coverage tradeoff to weigh.) No PR opened yet. Watcher `bpl1aug3x` armed. Last-seen: main

  - **EO/B4-P1 (ratification class-(ii) — SPEC amendment):** B4 edits `SPEC.md`. **M-4 SETTLED**
    (dispatch brief + plan §1) → ratification **collapses to ~0**; class applies but pre-settled →
    execute directly after verifying the amendment matches the settled M-4 intent.
  - **EO/B4-P2 (locus correction — LOAD-BEARING):** markers must land at **SPEC §7.21 prose
    (:415-417) + the §9 "AI role" AI-feature table row (:548)** — **NOT §13** (which is "Open
    questions," no AI table; plan §0 locus correction). Verify §9 not §13.
  - **EO/B4-P3 (SettingsView row removal):** remove the orphaned `'mermaid'` model-override row
    (`SettingsView.tsx:47`); verify `grep mermaid SettingsView.tsx` → nothing + frontend tests/
    typecheck adjusted.
  - **EO/B4-P4 (scope + serialize-with-D3):** SPEC.md + SettingsView.tsx + frontend test only. Base
    = current `main` @ `02871df`. **Serialize with D3 on SPEC.md** — D3 not open (HELD on OQ-1) so no
    collision. No reach into other slices. T-D14 (:654) cross-note + §15 API-table = executor
    discretion within the ruling (plan recommends a light T-D14 cross-note; leave §15).
  - **EO/B4-P5 (no over-reach — DEFER not delete/build):** M-4 = **defer** (add `*(deferred)*`),
    NOT remove the SPEC mermaid feature nor build it. Markers must preserve the feature as deferred;
    the ONLY removal is the orphaned Settings UI row. Deleting SPEC mermaid sections = over-reach.

    confirms OQ-1 directly to me** (§8.3 / rag-stab precedent). Whatever disposition D3 implemented
    (build/defer/remove), the merge is held on that confirmation.
  - **EO/D3-P2 (disposition fidelity):** verify D3's built disposition matches the eventual confirmed
    ruling. If build: per-field merge UI + archive surface (SPEC §7.27 actions). If defer: §7.27
    `*(deferred)*` markers. If remove: delete the two actions.
  - **EO/D3-P3 (halt-4 estimate-breach):** if build, the size (per-field merge UI + archive) may be
    L+ → auditor assesses halt-4; if it breaches its band, halt-and-re-slice, don't land oversized.
  - **EO/D3-P4 (scope + serialize-with-B4):** B4 (SPEC.md) already merged, so no live SPEC collision.

  - **EO/C1-P1 (ratification — normal IF no spec edit):** C1 BUILDS the markdown-export feature to

    path pattern). **KEY:** if C1 does NOT touch SPEC/CODE_SPEC/DECISIONS → normal slice, execute
    directly. If it edits a spec record → class-(ii), assess. Verify.
  - **EO/C1-P2 (substantive bar, M-5):** must actually build a working session→markdown serializer +
    "Copy as markdown" affordance; §7.20 claim becomes genuinely true (grep finds the impl). Auditor
    owns does-it-work; my lane: the claim-made-true is real.
  - **EO/C1-P3 (scope):** frontend serializer + UI + tests (+ optional thin backend route). Base =
    current `main` @ `ed4e6bb`. Independent (no collision); no reach into other slices.
  - **EO/C1-P4 (no silent partial / honesty):** must make §7.20 genuinely true — well-formed,
