# Executor wake-log — Slice A1 (Fastify v4→v5 + fast-uri pin)

**Slice:** A1 of the audit-remediation plan (`2026-06-06-audit-remediation-plan.md`).
**Finding:** M-1 (fastify + fast-uri portion). **Branch:** `claude/cool-cannon-J9BR5` → base `main`.
**Counterparts:** execution-auditor (fidelity + correctness), execution-overseer (governance).

One line per event. Each records: last-seen remote HEAD (`git ls-remote`), the audit-ID
set-diff for the commit (`N dropped / M added`), and per-thread round-trip counts (`X/5`).

- **2026-06-07** — Implementation commit. Last-seen remote `main` HEAD `ffa01ed` (`git ls-remote origin main`). Set-diff: **0 dropped / 0 added (baseline — no reviewer findings yet)**. Threads: none open.
  - Scope: bumped `packages/backend` `fastify ^4.27.0 → ^5.8.3`; resolved lockfile (fastify@5.8.5, find-my-way@9.6.0, fast-json-stringify@6.4.0, fast-uri@3.1.2 only — vulnerable `fast-uri@2.4.0` removed, no `pnpm.overrides` needed). One v5 source change: `error-handler.ts` `setErrorHandler<FastifyError>` (v5 defaults the error type to `unknown`).
  - **Floor note (plan-vs-reality, same direction):** plan §0 cites the `>=5.7.2` content-type floor; the current advisory set requires `>=5.8.3` (request.protocol/host spoofable, vulnerable `<=5.8.2`) — pinned `^5.8.3` (resolves 5.8.5) to honor the M-1 ruling intent (clear the fastify advisories). Documented in the PR; not a scope deviation.
  - **Audit delta (`pnpm audit --prod`):** **15 → 10** vulnerabilities. Cleared by A1: 3 High (Content-Type tab body-validation bypass; fast-uri path-traversal; fast-uri host-confusion) + 1 Moderate (request.protocol/host spoofable) + 1 Low (sendWebStream DoS). Remaining 10 (protobufjs 1 Critical/4 High/4 Moderate; react-router 1 Moderate) are out of A1 scope → A2 (embeddings) / A3 (residual sweep).
  - **Gate:** typecheck ✓ · test ✓ (610 backend / 204 frontend) · lint ✓ · build ✓. Boot ✓ (`node dist/index.js` on `127.0.0.1:47823`: `/health`, `/api/methodologies` 200, SSE `/events` welcome frame, clean shutdown).
  - **Carry-forward for A2:** live `packages/backend/package.json` has `@xenova/transformers` under `optionalDependencies` (plan §0 calls it a direct dep) — verify scope before the embeddings swap.

- **2026-06-07** — Handover + executor final-marker commit. Last-seen remote: my branch `010a402`, auditor `claude/sharp-cerf-mZ381` `b96c72c`, overseer `claude/blissful-brown-POKvS` `7f668bd`, `main` `ffa01ed` (`git ls-remote`). Set-diff: **0 dropped / 0 added** (reviewers' A1 positions are pre-registered expectations, not findings against the diff — both recorded their own `0 dropped / 0 added` baseline). Threads: none open (0 findings; Gitar bot reviewed PR #140 ✅ Approved).
  - Wrote `handovers/2026-06-07-A1-fastify-v5-fast-uri.md` (audit before/after counts per A1-P6/CP-8) and flipped its `Status:` line to **final — approved by executor** (§4.7 final-marker). Approval comment to follow on PR #140. Verified A1 against both reviewers' pre-registered positions (auditor A1-P1…P8 / CP-1…CP-8; overseer P-SCOPE/P-SEQ/P-TOPO): all satisfied; A1 is not a ratification class (auto-merges on the standard gate).

- **2026-06-07** — On-wake (overseer branch `7f668bd→6306bdf`). Read overseer governance review on PR #140 + fresh `git ls-remote` (auditor `b96c72c`, overseer `6306bdf`, main `ffa01ed`, self `8036839`). **Convergence: executor ✓ + overseer ✓ @ `8036839`; auditor pending.** Set-diff: **0 dropped / 7 added** — now tracking overseer EO-1…EO-7. EO-1…EO-6 are Confirms/Note (no action; EO-6 = the same `optionalDependencies`/A2 carry-forward I logged). **EO-7** (OQ-2 merge-method push-back) accepted as overseer-lane governance — A1's *merge execution* is gated on the spec-author's OQ-2 ruling, A1's *content* is not a ratification class. No code/dep change (content byte-identical). Refined handover Open Questions for accuracy; PR reply posted. Threads: EO-7 **1/5**.
