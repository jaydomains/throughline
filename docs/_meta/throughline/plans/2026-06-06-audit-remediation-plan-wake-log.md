- **2026-06-06 · authoring commit (baseline).** Last-seen remote HEAD (main):
  `4980dfd0634e25bf66d46ce0037d7b0f2d843b92`. Set-diff: `0 dropped / 0 added (baseline —
  no reviewer findings yet)`. Round-trips: none open (draft PR not yet opened). Action:
  authored `2026-06-06-audit-remediation-plan.md` covering M-1…M-14 (14 findings →
  slices A1–A3, B1–B6, C1, D1–D3, final PLATFORM_STATUS refresh, M-14 no-action;
  M-6/OQ-1 surfaced to spec-author and held). Opening the draft PR next; watcher to be
  armed on PR open.

- **2026-06-06 · PR-open + watcher armed (substantive-action record).** Draft **PR #135**
  opened against `main`; OQ-1 (M-6) surfaced to spec-author as a tagged PR comment + plan §2.
  Counterpart-change-detector armed (persistent, 60s, `SELF_EXCLUDE` = my exact branch;
  broad-arm unscoped on a quiet remote for first-branch discovery). Arm-time manual scan
  recorded pre-existing branches `audit-overpass` (#133, static), `bold-cannon-S1V32`,
  `loving-meitner-TZNYK`.

- **2026-06-06 · wake — both reviewers pre-registered baselines.** Last-seen remote tips:
  `main` `4980dfd` · auditor `claude/stoic-keller-jSY5K` `824466b` (pre-registered positions
  + wake-log) · overseer `claude/elegant-einstein-fsSgg` `ff0893f` (pre-registered governance
  positions). On-wake pairing done: fetched + diffed both reviewer branches **and** read PR
  #135 comments (Gitar bot auto-approved — CI layer, not a human sign-off). **No findings
  against the draft yet** — both are independent pre-read baselines. Set-diff:
  `0 dropped / 0 added` (no reviewer findings yet; planner-initiated accuracy fix — M-4 locus
  §13→§9, line 548, verified under `## 9. AI role`). Round-trips: all threads `0/5`.

- **2026-06-06 · round 1 — folded all 8 reviewer findings.** Last-seen remote tips: `main`
  `4980dfd` · auditor `claude/stoic-keller-jSY5K` `cee691b` (review COMMENTED @ `4639f70`: A-1,
  A-2, A-3 inline) · overseer `claude/elegant-einstein-fsSgg` `8fb8f9b` (OV-1..3 + supplement
  OV-4, OV-5 + a class-(iv) spec-author surface). On-wake pairing done: fetched + diffed both
  reviewer branches **and** read all PR #135 reviews + review-comments + issue-comments. Each
  finding verified against ground truth before folding (role-file externalization for OV-1;
  Phase-E halt-class source set + 4–9 for A-3; SPEC §11/§601/§51 for A-2). **Folds:** A-1/OV-4
  merge-method — §6 made method-agnostic, §8 defers to execution-overseer's lane + references the
  overseer's class-(iv) surface, **OQ-2 added to §2**, B1 tied to the OQ-2 ruling; A-2/OV-5 —
  D1 resolved to *provide* a single-command setup (primary, no spec edit) + conditional class-(ii)
  fallback, D1 added to §4 table; A-3 — B1 source breadth widened with per-class Phase-E
  citations + don't-invent guard + "blessed set is 4–9 (six)" correction; OV-1 — §4 + B1 + B3
  "no role-file back-port owed" note; OV-2 — §3.C reworded off uncodified halt-8; OV-3 — §1
  ruling-provenance note (authenticated dispatch briefing, not #133). **No push-backs** — all
  eight agreed. Set-diff: `0 dropped / +8 added (A-1, A-2, A-3, OV-1, OV-2, OV-3, OV-4, OV-5)`;
  M-1…M-14 coverage unchanged. Round-trips: A-1/A-2/A-3/OV-1/OV-2/OV-3/OV-4/OV-5 each `1/5`.
