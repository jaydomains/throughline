# Throughline — Phase 4 Handover

**Generated:** 2026-05-13 (pre-merge)
**Last commit SHA:** see PR head — 2026-05-13
**Previous handover:** `docs/_meta/throughline/handovers/2026-05-13-phase-3-5-projects-create-ui.md` (Phase 3.5 — projects create UI)

Phase 4 lands the six capture surfaces (scratchpad, session dump zone, library dump zone, voice input, Claude Code push, code TODO/FIXME import) per SPEC §7.6 and the CHECKLIST §Phase 4 row set. It also brings the AI integration plumbing online (Anthropic SDK-free HTTPS client, cost telemetry per call, prompt fingerprint per T-D24) so Phase 5 reconcile, Phase 12 companion review, and Phase 13 session-start scaffolding inherit a working AI path. The minor library service shipped here is the smallest slice that lets the library dump zone apply; the full library surface lands in Phase 6.

## Build State vs Spec

| Spec requirement | State | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scratchpad always-visible in header, no AI, no review (T-D20) | built | `packages/frontend/src/components/Scratchpad.tsx`; `packages/backend/src/scratchpad/service.ts`; `test/scratchpad.test.ts`; `test/scratchpad.test.tsx` | Project-scoped jots; Cmd+Enter saves. No `propose`/`apply` calls. |
| Session dump zone (paste + file drop, bundle-aware AI extraction, review modal) | built | `packages/frontend/src/components/DumpZone.tsx`; `DumpZoneReviewModal.tsx`; `packages/backend/src/dump-zone/extractor.ts`; `service.ts`; `routes.ts`; `test/dumpZone.test.ts`; `test/dumpZone.test.tsx` | Anthropic Sonnet when key present; heuristic fallback otherwise (SPEC §15 degrade-gracefully). |
| Library dump zone (same paradigm) | built | `DumpZone` with `target='library'`; `packages/backend/src/library/{service,routes}.ts`; `LibraryView` in `views/stubs.tsx` | Minimal library: create + list only. Full library surface (attach-to-item, prompts/snippets editors, search) lands in Phase 6. |
| Bundle-aware extraction parameterised by active project's bundle | built | `dump-zone/extractor.ts` injects `policy.types` / `policy.statuses` into the Anthropic system prompt; heuristic uses `policy.types[0]` / `policy.statuses[0]`; apply re-validates via `bundleItemPolicy` | Freeform-bound projects extract as `task` / `open`. the rich bundle wiring (Phase 7) extends the policy without changing this path. |
| Review modal shows proposed-items + cross-session re-route | built | `DumpZoneReviewModal.tsx` per-row target session select; `test/dumpZone.test.tsx` case "lets the user cross-route an item" | Re-route is a `target_session_id` field on each `ProposedItem`. |
| Voice input (browser-native, desktop-only, destination toggle, dump-zone pipe) | built | `packages/frontend/src/components/VoiceCapture.tsx` | Destination ("session vs library dump zone" per §7.6) is resolved by mounting one `VoiceCapture` per `DumpZone` instance; the surface the user opens determines destination. Single-pane voice overlay with surface toggle is deferred — flagged below. |
| Claude Code push: inbox dir, watcher, queue, project routing, archive, quarantine (T-D16, T-D37) | built | `packages/backend/src/inbox/{watcher,worker,routes}.ts`; `test/inbox.test.ts` covers prefix-routing, last-active fallback, orphan-quarantine, empty-file quarantine, idempotent enqueue | Filename-prefix routing per `<projectId>__<rest>` convention (per AskUserQuestion decision). 30-day archive retention policy is declared but the cleanup job lands with Phase 15 hygiene per CODE_SPEC §17. |
| Code TODO/FIXME import: manual trigger, default `TODO:`/`FIXME:`/`XXX:` | built | `packages/backend/src/code-todo/{scanner,service,routes}.ts`; `HomeView` button in `views/stubs.tsx`; `test/codeTodo.test.ts` | Scanner walks the repo honouring a small ignore list (`node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `build`, etc.); proposes one item per match via the same dump-zone pipeline. |
| All non-scratchpad surfaces apply only after review (T-D5) | built | All capture sources funnel through `dump-zone/service.propose` → `proposed_extractions` row in `pending`; only `apply` mutates `items` / `library_entries` | Inbox worker writes a `pending` proposal and surfaces it via `GET /api/projects/:id/dump-zone/proposals`; user opens the review modal and applies. |
| Cost telemetry + audit fingerprint when AI is used (T-D24, T-D29) | built | `dump-zone/service.ts` writes `cost_telemetry` + audit-log row with `prompt_fingerprint` on every Anthropic-backed propose; `test/dumpZone.test.ts` "Anthropic extractor records cost telemetry" case | Heuristic path writes neither (zero-token + non-AI actor). |

## Last Decision Minted

No new T-D / C-D anchors. Implementation followed existing decisions: T-D5 (review-before-apply), T-D16 (CC push), T-D20 (scratchpad friction-free), T-D24 (prompt fingerprint, never full prompts), T-D29 (cost telemetry), T-D37 (autonomous archive/quarantine carve-out), T-D47 (every project binds to a bundle). C-D anchors not minted; this slice is implementation-shape against the existing C-D ledger.

Conventions adopted (apply going forward):

- **All capture surfaces share one extraction pipeline.** Paste, voice, inbox, and code-todo all call `dump-zone/service.propose(...)` with a different `source` value. The review modal is the single applying chokepoint. New capture surfaces (future Slack import, etc.) extend the `ProposalSource` enum and route through the same path. This is the contract that makes "all non-scratchpad surfaces apply only after review" enforceable rather than aspirational.
- **AI integrations follow `Extractor`-style interfaces with heuristic fallbacks.** Pattern: define a typed interface (input → output), build the Anthropic-backed implementation that records cost telemetry + audit fingerprint, build a heuristic fallback that returns the same shape, route via a `RoutingExtractor` that checks `client.available()` at call time so settings changes don't require a restart. Phase 5 (reconcile), Phase 12 (companion review), Phase 13 (session-start) follow the same shape.
- **Anthropic talked to directly over `fetch`, not via `@anthropic-ai/sdk`.** `packages/backend/src/ai/anthropic.ts` is a thin HTTPS wrapper. The SDK adds 200kb of types + a complete generator we don't need yet — the surface we use is tiny (messages.create). Promotable to the SDK in one file when Phase 5+ pulls in features (streaming, prompt caching) that warrant it.
- **Library entry creation is the minimum-needed slice.** Library UI lives in Phase 6. Phase 4 lands `create + list + get` and nothing else so the library dump zone can apply. Phase 6 extends the same service with `update`, `delete`, `attachToItem`, search, repo `.md` ingestion — same convention as Phase 3 expanding items beyond Phase 1's bare CRUD.
- **Form-row / form-actions / form-error styles promoted to a shared block.** The Phase 3.5 handover flagged that scoping these under `.new-project-modal` was a single-modal scope. Phase 4 lands the second modal-bearing form (dump-zone review) so the styles now live in `:where(.new-project-modal, .dump-zone-modal)` plus a top-level `.form-actions` / `.form-error` / `.form-hint`. Future modals extend the `:where(...)` list, or if four modals coexist, promote `.form-row` to a bare class.
- **Streamed-input snapshot-then-replace.** When an external input source (speech recognition, future drag-while-typing handlers, anything that emits cumulative interim updates) streams updates into an existing text field, the consumer snapshots the pre-update state on the input's `onStart` event and treats incoming updates as authoritative replacements of the streamed portion — not appends. Speech recognition emits cumulative transcripts on each interim event ("hello", then "hello world", then "hello world today"), so the append shape would triple the text on a three-update stream. `packages/frontend/src/components/DumpZone.tsx` is the reference: `preVoiceTextRef` snapshots on `VoiceCapture.onStart`, each `onTranscript` does `setText(base + transcript)`, and `onSubmit`/`onCancel` clear the snapshot. Future streamed-input integrations follow the same shape.
- **Filesystem scanners use `readdirSync({ withFileTypes: true })` and skip symlinks by default.** Convention: walk with `Dirent[]` and `dirent.isSymbolicLink()` returns one direct check rather than the indirect "did `statSync(absolute_path)` follow the link" pattern. Two wins: prevents infinite recursion on symlinks pointing to ancestor directories (a real risk in monorepos including Throughline's own repo), and cuts roughly one syscall per directory entry. The scanner only follows symlinks when it has a specific reason to (none today). `packages/backend/src/code-todo/scanner.ts` is the reference; the per-file `statSync` survives only as the size pre-filter so big binaries with text-like extensions don't get slurped into memory.
- **Inbox archive/quarantine filenames carry the queue row ID prefix.** Two Claude Code sessions can each produce a file with the same basename (transcript.md, session-notes.md) — without the prefix the second archive write would silently overwrite the first. Convention: every artefact moved out of the inbox is renamed `<queue_row_id>__<original_basename>`. Bonus audit signal: the archive directory alone (without `cc_inbox_queue`) is enough to reconstruct what ran when. `packages/backend/src/inbox/worker.ts` implements; the `inbox_processed` / `inbox_failed` audit-log rows record both `original_filename` and the prefixed `archived_as` / `quarantined_as` value.

## Active Blockers

_none_

Provisional / parked items:
- **Voice input language toggle** — voice capture defaults to `en-US`. The ROADMAP §13-unresolved row for voice input language remains open: SPEC §13 has no recommendation. Setting toggle lands when a non-English speaker needs it.
- **Inbox archive retention cleanup** — 30-day retention is declared in `CODE_SPEC.md §5` but the periodic cleanup job that prunes old archived files lands with Phase 15 hygiene (alongside the cost meter + orphaned-rules panel). Disk fills slowly; not a blocker.
- **Single voice overlay with destination toggle** — §7.6 describes a "voice capture overlay" with a "toggle in the voice capture overlay" for destination. Phase 4 resolves this by mounting one `VoiceCapture` per `DumpZone` instance (session or library) so the destination is implicit. The literal "toggle inside one overlay" lands if the UX is felt insufficient in real use.

## Drift Flags

| Flag | File | What drifted | How resolved |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voice destination toggle ↔ §7.6 wording | `packages/frontend/src/components/VoiceCapture.tsx` | §7.6 reads "the user picks the destination (session dump zone or library dump zone) via a toggle in the voice capture overlay." Phase 4 implementation mounts one `VoiceCapture` per `DumpZone`, so the destination is determined by which dump zone the user opened, not by a toggle inside the overlay. Functionally equivalent (user picks destination before recording), but literally a different UX shape. | Accepted as-is; flagged in Active Blockers as "single voice overlay with destination toggle" for future revisit if needed. The decision lets every capture surface use the same `VoiceCapture` component without a destination-selection layer on top. |
| Anthropic SDK vs raw fetch | `packages/backend/src/ai/anthropic.ts` | Provisional plan in CODE_SPEC §4 names `@anthropic-ai/sdk` as the integration mechanism. Phase 4 ships a thin `fetch`-based client instead — the SDK pulls in a complete generator we don't need yet, and the surface we use (one POST endpoint) is small. | Accepted; convention added to "Last Decision Minted" — promotable to the SDK in one file when streaming / prompt caching / batch features become useful (Phases 12+). |
| Cost telemetry test row count | `packages/backend/test/dumpZone.test.ts` "Anthropic extractor records cost telemetry" | First draft expected exactly one cost row; the Anthropic-path propose also runs through `recordCost`, but the heuristic fallback in the mock-client path didn't, which initially surfaced a confusing "row count was 0" failure when the test ran the heuristic branch by accident (mock client `available()` returning false before the test set it true). | Test now uses an explicit `available: () => true` mock client and a JSON-returning `call`; the assertion is for one row with input_tokens=100 / output_tokens=50, mirroring the mock response. |
| Voice transcript duplication | `packages/frontend/src/components/DumpZone.tsx` | Original `onTranscript` appended the new transcript to `text`. Speech recognition emits cumulative transcripts per interim event, so a three-event stream of "hello", "hello world", "hello world today" produced text containing all three concatenated — triple-counting. Caught in gitar review. | `preVoiceTextRef` snapshots the textarea on `VoiceCapture.onStart`; each `onTranscript` does `setText(snapshot + transcript)`. `VoiceCapture` now exposes `onStart`/`onCancel` callbacks so the consumer can manage the snapshot lifecycle. Regression covered by `test/voiceCapture.test.tsx`. Convention added: streamed-input snapshot-then-replace. |
| Dead `.git/` startsWith check | `packages/backend/src/code-todo/scanner.ts` | The walk had `IGNORED_DIR_NAMES.has(entry) || entry.startsWith('.git/')`. `entry` is a single directory name, not a path, so the `startsWith('.git/')` arm was unreachable — `.git` itself is already in IGNORED_DIR_NAMES. | Removed the dead clause. Caught in gitar review. |
| Symlink-followed walk | `packages/backend/src/code-todo/scanner.ts` | Original used `statSync` per entry, which follows symlinks transparently. A symlink pointing back at an ancestor directory caused unbounded recursion — real risk in monorepos and likely when scanning Throughline's own repo. | Walk now uses `readdirSync({ withFileTypes: true })` + `dirent.isSymbolicLink()` to skip symbolic entries entirely. `statSync` survives as the per-file size pre-filter so big binaries don't get slurped. Regression covered by `test/codeTodo.test.ts` "skips symlinks rather than following them" with both a self-link directory and a file alias. Convention added: filesystem scanners use withFileTypes and skip symlinks by default. |
| Inbox archive/quarantine filename collisions | `packages/backend/src/inbox/worker.ts` | Original wrote `<archiveDir>/<dateSubdir>/<basename>`. Two distinct queue rows with the same basename (very plausible: two CC sessions producing `transcript.md`) would overwrite — silent data loss. | Filename is now `<queue_row_id>__<basename>` in both archive and quarantine. Audit-log rows for `inbox_processed` / `inbox_failed` carry both the original name and the prefixed name. Regression covered by `test/inbox.test.ts` "two files with the same basename from different sessions both land — no collision". Convention added: inbox archive/quarantine filenames carry the queue row ID prefix. |

## Open Questions

- [ ] **Single voice overlay with destination toggle vs per-dump-zone voice button.** Lands in a future capture-UX slice if real-use feedback shows the per-surface model adds friction (e.g., user wants to record once and then pick destination).
- [ ] **Voice input language default beyond `en-US`.** Tracks SPEC §13 open question; needs spec author direction.
- [ ] **Inbox archive retention cleanup job.** Lands with Phase 15 hygiene; not a blocker for any current feature.
- [ ] **Cost meter UI surfacing.** `cost_telemetry` rows write per AI call from this phase onward; the actual cost meter pill currently shows `$0.00 today`. Wiring to live spend lands in Phase 15.
- [ ] **AI-key configuration UI.** Backend reads from `~/.throughline/secrets.json` per T-D4. There's no UI yet for writing the key; manual edit only. Settings UI for keys lands with Phase 15.
- [ ] **Frontend tests for `VoiceCapture`.** Browser `SpeechRecognition` is absent in jsdom; testing the recognition flow needs a mocked global. Skipped this slice — the unsupported-fallback branch is exercised implicitly via every test that mounts `DumpZone`.

---

## Recently Resolved

- **"Phase 2 ScratchpadPlaceholder shown as not-yet-persisted."** — flagged in the Phase 2 handover and Phase 3.5 handover. Real `Scratchpad` now persists to `scratchpad_jots`; placeholder deleted.
- **"Stub writes for cost_telemetry; producers wire up when AI features land in Phase 4+."** — Phase 1 row that was annotated "producers wire up when AI features land in Phase 4+." Producers now write real rows on every Anthropic-backed dump-zone extraction.

---

## Cross-Module Dependencies

**Upstream (this slice consumes):**
- Phase 1 backend: project + bundle loader + audit log + cost telemetry helpers + items + sessions services. SQLite migrations chain.
- Phase 2 frontend substrate: `useModalRegistration` for the dump-zone review modal; `Header` slot for `Scratchpad` + `InboxStatus`; `.modal-backdrop` / `.modal` shared styles.
- Phase 3 backend: `ItemsService.create` is the apply-time write target for session-target proposals; the bundle policy (`bundleItemPolicy`) is re-validated at apply time.
- Phase 3.5 conventions: state-refresh-then-navigate pattern (still observed in the dump-zone modal's `onApplied` → `refresh()`); modal-component-owns-submitting-lifecycle (review modal resets `applying` on both success and error).

**Downstream (consumes this slice's work):**
- **Phase 5 reconcile engine.** The `Extractor` interface + heuristic-fallback + cost-telemetry + audit-fingerprint pattern is the template Phase 5's `ReconcileEngine` follows. The six-category diff (T-D35) routes through a similar review-modal flow.
- **Phase 6 library + directives.** Extends the minimal `library/service.ts` with update/delete/attach-to-item + the four content types' editors. Directives + repo `.md` ingestion are independent.
- **Phase 8 methodology gates.** Pre-write moment dispatcher can re-use the inbox signal-file convention if/when spec author confirms `pre-write` trigger mechanism (CODE_SPEC §7 unresolved item 1).
- **Phase 11 Semble integration.** Dump-zone review modal will show Semble code-ref suggestions per CHECKLIST §Phase 11 "Dump zone item creation enrichment: Semble suggestions appear in review modal" — extends `ProposedItem` with an optional `code_refs` field. The shape already exists on `ProposedItem.code_ref` for the code-todo source; Phase 11 generalises.
- **Phase 14 RAG.** Cost telemetry rows are now real; the cost meter visualisation in §7.25 has data to display from this phase forward. Audit-log audit-substrate queries can filter on `actor='ai'` and the `dump_zone_extraction` feature label.
- **Phase 15 hygiene.** Archive retention pruning + cost meter UI + secrets-file UI all consume artefacts landed here.
